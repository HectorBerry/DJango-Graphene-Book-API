# DJANGO GRAPHQL BOOK API
This is a basic CRUD API using Django and Graphql with Graphene

# Setup

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for your project, it's recommended to use a virtual environment.
Creating a Virtual Environment

# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/the/project

# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
`python -m venv venv`

Activating the Virtual Environment

`source venv/bin/activate`

Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install project dependencies using pip.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Deactivating the Virtual Environment

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

`deactivate`

# Usage
To start the server simply run(inside the venv):

`python manage.py runserver`

Then go to localhost:8000/graphql to query the api
