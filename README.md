# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv

Activating the Virtual Environment

    Windows:

    bash

venv\Scripts\activate

Unix or MacOS:

bash

    source venv/bin/activate

Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install project dependencies using pip.
